This project plays the tune of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" using Indian classical Sargam notes (Sa, Re, Ga, Ma, Pa, Dha) in MATLAB. The song is synthesized using sine wave representations of each note's frequency.

ðŸ§  Features
*Implements basic sound synthesis in MATLAB using sine functions.
*Maps each Sargam note to a specific frequency (in Hz).
*Sequences notes to recreate the melody of the popular nursery rhyme.
*Adds pauses between lines to maintain rhythm and clarity.

ðŸŽ¶ Musical Notes Used (Sargam)
